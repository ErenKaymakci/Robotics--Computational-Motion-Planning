# Robotics--Computational-Motion-Planning

This repository contains first week of assignment (A* and Dijkstra's algorithm) for the University of Pennsylvania/Coursera in the 
Robotics Specialization: Computational Motion Planning without matlab. I've converted 
what i did in  matlab assignment to python.
